

Webserver hostname : 3.86.245.94


The controller machine is running on a Redhat and the host machine is an amazon linux 2 instance.

The host machine has been connected using a SSH-Keygen via the controller, also the publickey has been added to authorized_keys as requested.


[fw.yaml]

Firstly we need to enable the firewall to allow open connections to HTTP and HTTPS requests.

So we run the fw.yaml file with ansible-playbook fw.yaml -b

This playbook *adds* rules.
It does not delete existing rules.




[webserver.yaml]

ansible-playbook webserver.yaml -b

Here, we need to install and enable the HTTPD apache server followed by mariadb, python and php with respective dependencies.

I have added these into another playbook where the ansible modules are defined.


Now, we copy the program and db files in to the host machine and initialize the database.
